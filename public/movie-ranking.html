<h1>The Best Movies According to Charlie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Your Name</h3>
<p>I love this movie because of its amazing animation.</p>
<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>This is an impressive movie. Above all, the actors in real life had to learn to handle military jets.</p>
<h3>Spiderman: No Way Home</h3>
<p>It's incredible because they put the 3 Spider-Mans together in a single movie with the theme of the multiverses.</p>
